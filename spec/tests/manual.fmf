summary: Test automation state

story:
    As a tester I need to store detailed manual instructions covering
    test scenario I have to perform manually.

description: |
    Attribute marks whether this test needs human interaction during its execution.

    Such tests are not likely to be executed in automation pipelines.
    In the future they can be executed in semi-automated way, waiting on human interaction.
    It's value should be a ``bool``. The default value is ``false``.
    Attribute :ref:`/spec/tests/test` should point to a Markdown document following `CommonMark <https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/>`_ spec
    where following sections are recognizes by TMT and have special meaning. Any other features of Markdown can be used, but TMT will just show them.

    Recognized sections:
      ``# Setup``
        Optional heading under which any necessary preparation actions are documented. These actions are not part of the test itself.
      ``# Test`` or ``# Test .*``
        Required heading of level 1 starting with word 'Test' marks beginning of the test itself. You can use several Test sections in the document.
      ``## Step`` or ``## Test step``
        Required heading of level 2 marking single step of the test, should be in pair with Expect section which follows it. Cannot be used outside test sections.
      ``## Expect`` or ``## Expected result`` or ``## Result``
        Required heading of level 2 marking expected outcome of the previous step. Cannot be used outside test sections.
      ``# Cleanup``
        Optional heading under which any cleanup actions which are not part of the test itself are documented
      Code block
        Optional, can be used in any section to mark code snippets. Specification of the code type (bash, python,...) is just for syntax highlighting purposes.

    See examples of `documents <https://github.com/psss/tmt/tree/master/examples/manual/>`_ for a better idea.
