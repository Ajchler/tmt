summary: Manual test execution details

story:
    As a tester I want to store detailed manual instructions
    covering test scenario so that I can perform them manually
    before the test can be fully automated.

description: |
    Sometimes test scenarios cannot be fully automated or it takes
    time to fully automate them. For such cases the ``manual``
    attribute can be used to describe test steps in detail. It
    should be a ``dictionary`` with the following keys, each one
    of them should be a ``string``.

    setup
        Environment preparation instructions.
    step
        Test step, action to be performed.
    expect
        Expected results of the test step.
    cleanup
        Environment cleanup instructions.

    If there are several individual steps they can be stored, with
    their corresponding expected results, as a list of dictionaries
    under the ``steps`` key.

    manual:
        setup:
            sudo dnf install -y tmt
        step:
            Run 'tmt init --template full'.
        expect:
            Example story, plan and test created.
        cleanup:
            sudo dnf remove -y tmt

    manual:
        setup:
            sudo dnf install -y tmt
        steps:
          - step:   Run 'tmt init --template full'.
            expect: Example story, plan and test created.
          - step:   Run 'tmt'.
            expect: Found 1 test, 1 plan and 1 story displayed.
          - step:   Run 'tmt --help'
            expect: Available commands and options listed.
        cleanup:
            sudo dnf remove -y tmt
