summary: Files or directories to be collected after test execution

story:
    As a tester I want to collect files or directories produced by
    test so I can process them later. Some of the collected artifacts
    can be understood by tmt.

description: |
    Test can produced artifacts as coverage data, junit summaries,
    coredumps or other interesting data.

    Artifact can be either path to the file or directory, bash wildcards
    are accepted. In case of the directory its whole content is collected.

    Another possible value of artifact is a dictionary where key marks type of the data.
    Value of the dictionary should be string or list of string representing paths.

    Should be a ``artifact`` or ``list of artifacts`` where artifact is either ``string`` or ``dictionary``

example: |
    artifact: FILE

    artifact: [FILE, DIRECTORY]

    artifact:
        - DIRECTORY
        - junit: FILE
