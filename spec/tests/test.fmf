summary: Shell command which executes the test

story:
    As a test writer I want to run a single test script in
    multiple ways (e.g. by providing different parameters).

description: |
    This attribute defines how the test is to be executed.
    Allows to parametrize a single test script and in this way
    create virtual test cases.

    Special value ``manual`` can be used for tests which haven't
    been automated yet. Such tests will be skipped during test
    execution. In the future we might add support for executing
    manual tests using user input to provide actual test results.

    Should be a ``string``. This is a **required** attribute.

example: |
    test: ./test.sh
    test: ./test.sh --depth 1000
    test: pytest -k performance
    test: make run

implemented: /tmt/base
