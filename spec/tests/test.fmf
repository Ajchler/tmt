summary: Shell command which executes the test

story:
    As a test writer I want to run a single test script in
    multiple ways (e.g. by providing different parameters).

description: |
    This attribute defines how the test is to be executed.
    Allows to parametrize a single test script and in this way
    create virtual test cases.

    If test is manual (see :ref:`/spec/tests/manual`) it points to the document
    describing the test case steps in Markdown format with defined structure.

    Should be a ``string``. This is a **required** attribute.

example: |
    test: ./test.sh
    test: ./test.sh --depth 1000
    test: pytest -k performance
    test: make run

    test: manual.md
    manual: true
