summary: Allow disabling individual tests

story:
    As a developer or tester I want selected tests to be skipped
    during test execution by marking them as disabled.

description:
    When a test is broken and it is not possible to fix it
    immediately there should be an easy way how to temporarily
    mark it as disabled so that it's skipped during the test suite
    execution. Should be a ``boolean``. The default value is
    ``true``.

example: |
    enabled: false

    # list only enabled tests
    tmt tests ls --filter enabled:true

implemented: /tmt/base
