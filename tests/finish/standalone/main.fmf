summary: Check that finish works without push
description:
    When tmt is used just to provision machine, push doesn't need to happen
    But finish should still work
# By default we run under a container only
environment:
    METHODS: container
adjust:
  - when: trigger == commit
    environment:
        METHODS: container local
    because: the pipeline does not support nested virtualization
  - when: how == full
    environment:
        METHODS: container virtual local
    because: local/virtual provision needs root/full virtualization
