  # Integration tests with requre support
  This part of testsuite uses project requre: https://github.com/packit/requre

  It stores communication with nitrate server to local files (`test_data` directory) where tests are defined.

  ## Regeneration
  If you want to regenerate some file for test, just remove existing response file and run it
  on your machine with your credentials:
  ```
  rm -rf tests/integration/test_data/*
  cd tests/integration
  pytest -v
  ```

  ## Remove sensitive data
  If there are any sensitive data you can use requre-patch tool from requre project and remove
  whatever you want, e.g. timestamps, any sensitive urls, tokens, passwords
  syntax is `key_identifiers:key_in_response:python_type:replaced_value`

  Example:
  ```
  requre-patch purge --replaces :milestone_url:str:SomeText tests/integration/test_data/test_nitrate/*
  ```

  ## Debugging
  To see if there is no network communication, just use e.g. `unshare` command
  ```
  cd tests/integration
  sudo unshare -n sudo -u `whoami` pytest -v test_nitrate.py
  ```
test: "python3 -m pytest -v"
environment:
  REQURE_MODE: read
framework: shell
require:
  - python3-pytest
tag: [integration]
tier: null
